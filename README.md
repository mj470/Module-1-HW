# <Module 1 Homework>

## Description 
This homework project was to add semantic elements to an HTML file making it more accessible and readable. This was done by chaning non-semantic elements in the HTML file to read more discriptive sections as well as adding alternate attributes that would read for accessibility features on a webpage. The readability of the CSS file was also clarified by consilidating repetivie code. 

Using Semantic HTML and clarifying the CSS file makes looking at these sets of code more readable from a development standpoint in addition to making the webiste more accesible to an visual imparments etc. This is a great project to practice using semantic elements and what I learned is how much easier it is to read a semantic file compared to the generic div class elements. 

## Installation 
This site will be deployed through the GitHub link provided that will access the deployed website.

## Usage
This page will be used to determine if enough semantic elements have been added approprietely to make a future web page accessible and readable. This will be shown through comments and the addition of specific attributes. 

## Credits 
I attended several zoom study groups where we discussed our ideas but we completed our own work.
